    <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>

    <p>
        I want to learn web development because it allows me to build useful and creative applications that people can interact with online.
    </p>

    <p>
        Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will help me understand how websites work and give me the skills to create my own projects.
